Steps: 
clone the repo <br/>
use Terminal to change the current working directory to the location where you have cloned the repo<br/>
#npm i <!-- #to install all the necessary packages!--> <br/> 
ensure you have your mongodb server up and running<br/>
open server.js file and enter your database name in the 10th line of the file<br/>
example: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/trial' <!-- where trial is the name of the database and 27017 is the default port on which mongodb starts!--> <br/>
#node server.js <!-- to start the server!--> <br/>
open your browser and access the server which is up at port 9999 <br/>
http://localhost:9999/index.html -> registration<br/>
http://localhost:9999/login.html -> login<br/>
http://localhost:9999/change-password.html -> change password<br/>
<br/>
<!-- if port 9999 is busy, change the port number in the server.js file - line number 116 and 117!-->
